# # Steps
#     # read pdf
#     # if pdf multiple pages: iterate over it
#     # extract image from pdf page, (check wich library use)
#     # Hypotesis: I need to know the coodinates of image and sizes so I can extract the position of the text found
#     # process the image to get text
#     # identify match
#     # if coordinates, find how to highlight matched text in image (overlay)
#     # and write all to a new file

# Create an EasyOCR Reader0< for English text recognition

# Load an image

# Recognize text in the image

# Print the recognized text and bounding boxes
